<p>Please complete this form to register for a new Auth account, please be aware that you are required to confirm your email account so please use a valid address.</p>

<h2>Problematic Providers</h2>
<p>In addition, some providers maybe blocked form auth due to their draconian spam detection routines, which has flagged this server numerous times for no reason. These include AT&T services, Cox, and a few other mainland US ISPs. If you have a Google Mail account please consider using that instead of your ISP email account.</p>

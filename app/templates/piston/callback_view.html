<h1>Access Authorization</h1>

    <p>Access is now enabled for the requesting application. It seems the application did not provide a way to give it the required information so you need to provide this to it. This has happened either due to it being a desktop application or not being configured properly.</p>

    <p>Token/PIN: <b>{{ token.verifier }}</td></p>

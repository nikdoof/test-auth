REQUIREMENTS
------------

Use ./setup-env.sh to setup the virtualenv for Auth, you'll also need the following packages (as named on Debian):

python-zeroc-ice (ZeroC ICE Bindings for Python, only needed if you are using Mumble connecitivty)
python-imaging (PIL)
python-mysqldb (MySQL connectors for Python)
python-crypto (SSL and related stuff for Django)

RUNNING
-------

For live envs, use ./start.sh, which runs a FCGI instance on port 9981.

For dev, use ./manage.py runserver <ip>:<port>, after loading the virtualenv

DB SETUP
--------

Copy over dbsettings.py.example and modify to your needs.


MUMBLE SETUP
------------

If you are using the Mumble SSO connector, then please copy over your Murmur.ice file to the root of the directory, if this 
doesnt match the current running Mumble server it'll cause a world of pain.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

Use ./setup-env.sh to setup the virtualenv for Auth, you'll also need the following packages (as named on Debian):

python-zeroc-ice (ZeroC ICE Bindings for Python, only needed if you are using Mumble connecitivty)
python-imaging (PIL)
python-mysqldb (MySQL connectors for Python)
python-crypto (SSL and related stuff for Django)
python-virtualenv (distribute enabled version)
python-distribute

Also you'll need a working RabbitMQ install, and your database software of choice.

RABBITMQ SETUP
--------------

The fabric config has all the options to auto configure this for you, just give sudo access to /usr/sbin/rabbitmqctl to 
your user.

VIRTUALENV SETUP
----------------

Most of Auth's dependancies are pulled through Virtualenv, to setup the enviroment use the ./setup-env.sh script. 

RUNNING
-------

For live envs, use ./start.sh, which runs a FCGI instance on port 9981.

For dev, use ./manage.py runserver <ip>:<port>, after loading the virtualenv. Load a seperate shell and start the Celery
work processor with ./manage.py celeryd

DB SETUP
--------

Copy over dbsettings.py.example and modify to your needs.


MUMBLE SETUP
------------

If you are using the Mumble SSO connector, then please copy over your Murmur.ice file to the root of the directory, if this 
doesnt match the current running Mumble server it'll cause a world of pain.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

The requirements.txt covers all dependencies for Auth, setup a virtual env and install the requirements:

virtualenv env
. env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

As we're using system wide packages, its advisable to install python-mysql packages system wide, otherwise you'll need a basic build env on your machine (build-essentials, python-dev on Debian).

RUNNING
-------

For dev, use ./manage.py runserver <ip>:<port>, after loading the virtualenv. In development Celery will operate in-process and doesn't require a seperate celeryd process to execute.
